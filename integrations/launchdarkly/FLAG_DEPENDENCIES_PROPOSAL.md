# LaunchDarkly Flag Dependencies Enhancement Proposal

## Executive Summary

This proposal outlines a plan to enhance the Port Ocean LaunchDarkly integration by adding feature flag dependency information. By leveraging LaunchDarkly's beta API for flag dependencies, we can provide users with valuable insights into the relationships between feature flags, enabling better management and risk assessment of feature flag changes.

## Current State

Currently, our LaunchDarkly integration provides information about:
- Projects
- Environments
- Feature flags
- Flag statuses across environments
- Audit logs

However, it lacks visibility into how feature flags are interconnected. When flags depend on each other, changes to one flag can have cascading effects on others, creating potential risks that are currently invisible to users.

## Proposed Enhancement

We propose to enhance the integration by adding flag dependency information to the existing flag-status blueprint. This will allow users to:

1. **Visualize Flag Dependencies**: See which flags depend on a given flag and which flags it depends on
2. **Assess Change Impact**: Understand the potential impact of changing a flag's status
3. **Identify Critical Flags**: Recognize flags that have many dependents and require careful management
4. **Track Dependency Chains**: Follow the chain of dependencies to understand complex relationships

## Data Source

LaunchDarkly provides a beta API endpoint for retrieving flag dependency information:
```
https://app.launchdarkly.com/api/v2/flag-dependencies/{projectKey}/{featureFlagKey}
```

This endpoint returns:
- Flags that depend on the specified flag
- Flags that the specified flag depends on

## Key Deliverables

1. **Enhanced Flag Status Blueprint**:
   - Add dependency count metrics
   - Show lists of dependent flags and flags depended on
   - Include dependency status information

2. **New Flag Dependency Visualization**:
   - Create a dependency graph visualization in Port
   - Enable filtering and navigation through dependencies

3. **Dependency Change Tracking**:
   - Capture changes to dependencies over time
   - Alert on critical dependency changes

4. **Documentation and Examples**:
   - Update integration documentation
   - Provide examples of dependency visualization and use cases

## User Benefits

1. **Risk Reduction**: Identify potential cascading effects before making flag changes
2. **Better Planning**: Understand dependencies when planning feature rollouts
3. **Improved Governance**: Identify critical flags that require stricter change control
4. **Enhanced Visibility**: Get a complete picture of the feature flag ecosystem
5. **Simplified Troubleshooting**: Quickly identify related flags when issues occur

## Implementation Approach

Our implementation will focus on these high-level steps:

1. **Data Collection**: Extend the LaunchDarkly client to retrieve dependency information
2. **Data Processing**: Process and format dependency data for Port
3. **Blueprint Enhancement**: Update the flag-status blueprint to include dependency information
4. **Relationship Mapping**: Create relationships between flags based on dependencies
5. **Webhook Integration**: Update webhook processing to capture dependency changes

## Technical Considerations

1. **API Beta Status**: The flag dependencies API is in beta and may change
2. **Performance Optimization**: Implement efficient data retrieval to minimize API calls
3. **Error Handling**: Add robust error handling for the beta API
4. **Backward Compatibility**: Ensure changes don't break existing functionality


## Success Metrics

1. **User Adoption**: Percentage of users viewing dependency information
2. **Dependency Coverage**: Percentage of flags with dependency information
3. **User Feedback**: Qualitative feedback on the usefulness of dependency data
4. **Issue Prevention**: Reduction in incidents related to flag changes

## Conclusion

Adding flag dependency information to our LaunchDarkly integration will significantly enhance its value by providing critical insights into the relationships between feature flags. This will help users better understand their feature flag ecosystem, reduce risks, and improve their feature flag management practices.

By implementing this enhancement, we'll provide a more comprehensive view of the LaunchDarkly environment in Port, further establishing Port as the central source of truth for development infrastructure.
